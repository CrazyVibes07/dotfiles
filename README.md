# My dotfiles for Linux

I use Arch Linux and Pop!_OS as my daily drivers.

# How to deploy my dotfiles?
1. You need [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k)
2. Copy the .zshrc and place it in your **home** folder.
3. Copy the .zshtheme file and place it inside the .oh-my-zsh folder which is also present in your home folder.
4. And finally copy the 2 folders inside the .config folder and place it inside your .config folder. If you don't have one, navigate to your home directory and type `mkdir .config`. Then place the `alacritty and nvim` folders inside that.

# I have taken some parts of the config files from other people and their names and github profiles are going to be listed below, go check them out.
